### Foldable calloutsÂ 

You can make a callout foldable by adding a plus (+) or a minus (-) directly after the type identifier.

A plus sign expands the callout by default, and a minus sign collapses it instead.

```markdown
> [!faq]- Are callouts foldable?
> Yes! In a foldable callout, the contents are hidden when the callout is collapsed.
```

Are callouts foldable?

### Nested callouts

You can nest callouts in multiple levels.

```markdown
> [!question] Can callouts be nested?
> > [!todo] Yes!, they can.
> > > [!example]  You can even use multiple layers of nesting.
```
