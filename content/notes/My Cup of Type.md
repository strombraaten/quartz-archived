Sideprosjekt som varte fra 2012 til ca 2016ish, hvor jeg og min gode venn Hallvar Bugge Johnsen (og mange andre) tegna sitater på kaffekopper – https://mycupoftype.tumblr.com/

Mens du venter på noe mer fornuftig å lese, så kan du få den engelske beskrivelsen som vi skreiv om dette prosjektet i 2013:

> My Cup of Type consists of two Norwegian guys, Simen Strøm Braaten & Hallvar Hauge Johnsen and a [**large group of contributing friends around the world.**](http://mycupoftype.tumblr.com/post/57834973647/wow-exactly-one-year-ago-to-this-day-we)   
> 
> The project was carved out of pure procrastination when we were studying in Melbourne together and has become a way for us to escape when shit gets tough. We have mastered the **[Art of Procrastination](https://href.li/?http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/)** and use it to channelize our creativity towards other projects. At least that’s what we feel we’re doing. 
> 
> Later on the concept has given us more meaning than just procrastinating. We also like to think that by drawing on a cup we extend the lifetime of it by making it into an artwork. No matter if the cup gets thrown in the garbage 5 minutes later or if it gets a place on a [**kitchen shelf in Geelong, Australia**](http://mycupoftype.tumblr.com/post/32509527170/better-luck-next-year-guys-heres-a-cheer-up), the cup gets another chance to live, to spread joy, to send a message and to entertain. We’re also a big fan of reusable cups (Like the [**KeepCup**](https://href.li/?http://www.keepcup.com/)), and if one cup can be saved from the trash bin we’re happy.
> 
> It’s become a playground for us to explore things like webshops, merchandise, stationary and something we’d like to call **“Lower you tresholds and publish that stuff, because people don’t know what’s hiding on your hard drive”.** The last part has become a kind of an ever evolving lifestyle for us. Stop being a perfectionist and get things done.  
> 
> We still love the reaction when people figures out that we run a blog where the key point is to publish a vast array of paper cups with doodles on them. “Why do you draw on cups?” “Really? I wanna try!”.
> 
> My Cup of Type has also given us a lot of knowledge about how to share content in an efficient way and how to manage one project on several social media channels. This very blog has also given us more attention than all of our other juggle balls. For us, this has shown that if you put enough love and effort into something, the rest of it comes naturally. **People can smell passion.**
